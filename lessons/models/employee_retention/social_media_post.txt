Last week, browsing Kaggle with our Data Science and Machine Learning learners at Bildup AI Learning Center in Enugu, I found an Employee Retention dataset. It immediately resonated—my first job nicknamed me "Bug Man."

The nickname stung. It reflected an environment that hadn't learned to nurture junior talent. Every bug felt magnified. Every mistake felt like proof I didn't belong. I worked long hours second-guessing every line.

Six months in, I was burnt out, underpaid, and questioning my career choice.

Nine months later, a friend recommended me to a Lagos company. The founder—an engineer with 18-20 years of experience—ran it differently. He debugged alongside us. Shared his codebases when we faced new tasks. Didn't just delegate and disappear.

I felt safe—safe to ask questions, make mistakes, and learn.

In that environment, I didn't just survive—I grew. In less than a year, I had two interns under me, reviewing their code. That taught me what great leadership is: creating space for others to find answers.

Today, I'm CTO at Bildup AI, a leading AI startup in Africa. I'm sharing this because if you're a developer feeling not good enough—the data says differently.

I built an Employee Retention Prediction Model using that dataset (15,000 employees). The data told a story:

Employees with low satisfaction + no promotions + below-market salaries have a 52% chance of leaving within a year. My first job stats? The model predicted I'd leave with 73% probability.

The insight: 43% of low-salary employees leave vs. just 7% of fairly compensated ones. Only 5% got promotions in five years; those who did had <5% turnover.

The data wasn't showing me I was the problem. It was showing the environment was.

What I've learned:

Your early struggles don't define your ceiling. That "Bug Man" phase taught me resilience and how not to lead.

The strongest retention predictor isn't talent—it's satisfaction + career progression. Employees with both stay. Those with one leave at moderate rates. Those with neither? Gone in two to three years.

Growth happens in supportive environments, not hostile ones. When you invest in people's growth, pay fairly, and create clear paths—they don't just stay. They innovate and build things that matter.

To developers feeling like "Bug Man/Woman":

- Your mistakes don't define your potential. Every senior dev has a graveyard of bugs behind them.
- If your environment makes you feel incompetent, it might be the environment, not you. The data backs this.
- Growth requires safety to experiment and learn. If you don't have that, it's okay to find it elsewhere.
- Your journey isn't linear. Mine went from "Bug Man" to CTO. Yours will have its own path.

To leaders:

Treating people well isn't just ethics, it's mathematically sound business strategy. Turnover costs far exceed investments in fair pay, growth opportunities, and supportive culture.

Build environments where "Bug Man" becomes "Senior Engineer" instead of "Former Employee."
